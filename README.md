For my password-generator I started by putting the various character types and putting them into their own arrays and setting them as variables. I then have a prompt asking how many characters long do you want your password. I then have some while loops that will trigger and alerts if input is NAN and and the integer is within the limits I set. Then I made some confirms that ask more questions about about what character types you want to include. If you answer true on a question it sends the corresponding array into an empty array. That empty array which is now full of the users responses is measured for length and multiplied by Math.floor(Math.Random()) and a random character is chosen from the array. We finally wrap that all in a function that is connected to our only even listener and initializes upon click of generate password button.
